# Findjob.io

Findjob.io is like priceline.com for jobseekers . We pull in APIâ€™s from top job sites and combine them into one simple search site where users can search, save jobs, and apply all from one place. 

## How it works:

1. Users type in a search term for jobs they are interested in.

2. Findjob.io pulls in data from several API's and eliminates duplicates to simplify the job search process.

3. The application keeps track of jobs that users save (future development).

4. Users can save a cover letter to a job (future development.)
